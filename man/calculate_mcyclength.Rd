\title{Calculate Menses-to-Menses Cycle Lengths
(test)}
\usage{
calculate_mcyclength(data, id, daterated, menses, ovtoday)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the required input variables.}

\item{id}{A unique identifier for individuals in the dataset.}

\item{daterated}{A date column indicating when the data was recorded.}

\item{menses}{A binary column (\code{0}/\code{1}) indicating the first day of menses onset, where \code{1} represents menses onset.}

\item{ovtoday}{A binary column (\code{0}/\code{1}) indicating the estimated day of ovulation, where \code{1} represents ovulation day.}
}
\value{
The input data frame with the additional following variables:
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{mcyclength}}: The length of a consecutive menses-to-menses cycle, measured in days.
\item \strong{\code{m2mcount}}: A forward count starting from each menses onset.
\item \strong{\code{cyclenum}}: The number of complete menses-to-menses cycles for each individual (\code{id}).
\item \strong{\code{cycle_incomplete}}: A binary variable (\code{0}/\code{1}), where \code{1} indicates that the row is not part of a complete cycle.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the lengths of menses-to-menses cycles for individuals in a longitudinal dataset.
The input dataset must be in long format, where each row represents a unique date for a specific individual.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The \code{menses} column should indicate the first day of menses onset for each individual, coded as \code{1} (menses) or \code{0} (no menses).
\item The \code{daterated} column should be a date variable recording when the data was collected.
\item The \code{ovtoday} column should indicate estimated ovulation days, also coded as \code{1} (ovulation day) or \code{0} (non-ovulation day).
