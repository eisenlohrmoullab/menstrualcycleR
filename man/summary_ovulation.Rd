\title{A function to provide information regarding ovulation confirmation/imputation}
\usage{
summary_ovulation(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing the input data. Must include columns for scaled cycle day variables and symptoms/dependent variables of interest.
Scaled cycle day variables are added to your dataframe after applying the calculate_mcyclength() and calculate_cycletime() functions. (See examples below)}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames: \code{ovstatus_total} and \code{ovstatus_id}.
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{ovstatus_total}}: Among complete cycles, this data frame summarizes:
\enumerate{
\item The number of cycles with confirmed ovulation.
\item The number of cycles with ovulation imputed based on Natural Cycles norms.
}
\item \strong{\code{ovstatus_id}}: For each unique ID, this data frame provides details for complete cycles:
\enumerate{
\item The number of cycles outside the 21â€“35 day range.
\item The number of cycles with confirmed ovulation.
\item The number of cycles with imputed ovulation based on Natural Cycles norms.
}
}
